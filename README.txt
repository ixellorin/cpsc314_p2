By submitting this file, we hereby declare that our team of two worked individually on this assignment
and wrote all of this code.  We have listed all external resoures (web pages, books) used below.  We have
listed all people with whom I/we have had significant discussions about the project above.

The ships are simple shapes, though we don't know how complicated was actually required because all it said on the
outline was for them to be "simple" shapes.

The click and drag doesn't update live but increases/decreases the desired value based on how far the mouse had
actually moved.

BONUSES:

Planets are their correct colors.
Orbital velocities and rotation speeds of planets are the correct ratios (relative to Earth's).
Added ability to slow down the orbital velocities while in geosynchronous mode.
